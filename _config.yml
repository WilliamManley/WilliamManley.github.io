 Motivated by research that makes a difference.

 I am currently a graduate mathematical sciences student at the University of Oxford.
 I am particularly interested in how a combination of mathematical and computational techniques can be employed to solve many novel problems arising in biological systems.

 My research/career ambitions are to be able to use such methods to allow informed decisions to be made that may have a substantial impact on important issues. Such applications
 may range from the development of treatment/understanding of a certain disease to gaining a better understanding of the underlying dynamics of a specific physiological system.

 For more information please consult <a href="documents/will_manley_cv.pdf">my CV</a> or contact me directly.
