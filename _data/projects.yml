    <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
    Lab based microscopy, at a non-specialist level involves the tedious task of focusing onto the
    prepared sample. If this process is needed to be completed many times it can be incredibly time consuming.
    Moreover, the human error involved in this task often results in a sub-optimal perception of absolute focus.
    This is therefore a process that can be optimised by the aid of machine input.

    Under supervision of the Micron research group at the University of Oxford,
    I worked on early stage development of the MicroscoPi imaging platform.
    The aim of the project was to produce a fully automated, robust, 3D printed
    microscopy platform. Specifically, my task was to develop and implement a
    fully automated autofocus module, that the user could run on any pre-prepared
    sample slide and readily obtain a focused sample perspective. <br> <br>
    <u><b>Main Challenges:</b></u> <br>
    **No Reference Image:**
    One thing that made this project unique was having no 'reference image' to compare
    against, since we needed to apply our module to any given prepared sample, and we
    were starting from a completely unfocused image. Hence, a "no reference pixel based" method
    (NRP) as commonly referenced in relevant literature was employed as the logical approach. <br>
    **Quantifying Focus:**
    The main problem that we needed to address was how to devise a metric to
    quantify how in/out of focus a sample is at each stage of the automated process. This
    corresponded to characterising the image artefact of 'blur' at each stage of the focal refinement process. Two metrics
    were developed, one using edge feature analysis and the other using Fourier spectra analysis.

   <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
   Turbulence is one of the most important, yet poorly understood of modern day mathematics. This is due to the inherent chaotic fluctations that
   can be readily observed in even relatively simple flow scenarios. Modern techniques of turbulence models, apply closure at the mean field. That is, they
   look at the mean flow and assume that there is no flow variance from stochastic fluctations. This project explores these techniques, as they are used in
   a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework.

   I was originally scheduled to complete this project as a research internship with the Institute of Mathematical Innovation at the University of Bath. However,
   due to the emergence of COVID-19 the funding for the project was withdrawn. Since this project partticularly interested me, I decided to work on the project anyway
   without supervision.

   The project proposal originally involved working alongside a structural engineering company and using OpenFOAM CFD turbulence modelling to conduct stress analysis
   on the boundaries of a given house structure, subject to a widely accepted model for the flow profile in the atmospheric boundary layer. I also decided to conduct
   some pedestrian analysis - looking at how the wind flow is distorted due to the presence of the house structure.

   <u><b>Main Challenges:</b></u> <br>
   **Computational Demand:**
   One of the biggest challenges in CFD is the amount of computational power required to run a simulation on a sufficiently refined computational mesh. Whilst a sufficiently
   refined mesh is desireable to allow for adequate 'blending' to occur through the viscous sublayers close to the solid boundaries, a trade off can be made in reducing the
   mesh resolution and using interpolating 'wall functions', that are widely studied and proposed in the literature, based on idealised experiments. This was a particularly
   hard problem since I didn't have access to a powerful machine. <br> S<br>
   **Numerical Discretisation:**
   Having only studied fluid dynamics at a theoretical level, it was important to develop an understanding of how the theory is realised in a numerical framework.This included
   making decisions on the most suitable finite volume schemes (FVS) to use for each operator and how each field is mapped through the geometry of successive cells in the mesh.
