    <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
    Lab based microscopy, at a non-specialist level involves the tedious task of focusing onto the
    prepared sample. Often this process is needed to be replicated multiple times and can become incredibly time consuming.
    Moreover, the human error involved in this task often results in a sub-optimal perception of absolute focus.
    This is therefore a process that can be optimised by the aid of machine input.

    Under supervision of the Micron research group at the University of Oxford,
    I worked on early stage development of the MicroscoPi imaging platform.
    The aim of the project was to produce a fully automated, robust, 3D printed
    microscopy platform. Specifically, my task was to develop and implement an autonomous
    autofocus module, that the user could run on any pre-prepared
    sample slide, under any light source and readily obtain a focused sample perspective.
    The crux of the problem was the reformulation of focus into a computer vision context. <br> <br>
    <u><b>Main Challenges:</b></u> <br>
    **No Reference Image:**
    One thing that made this project unique was having no 'reference image' to compare
    against, since we needed to apply our module to any given prepared sample, and we
    were starting from a completely unfocused image. Hence, a "no reference, pixel-based" method
    (NRP) as commonly referenced in relevant literature was employed as the logical approach. <br>
    **Quantifying Focus:**
    The main problem that we needed to address was how to devise a metric to
    quantify how in/out of focus a sample is at each stage of the automated process. This
    corresponded to characterising the image artefact of 'blur' at each stage of the focal refinement process. Two metrics
    were developed, one using edge feature analysis and the other using Fourier spectra analysis.

   <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
   Turbulence is one of the most abundant, yet poorly understood phenomena in the physical world. Huge difficulty arises due to the inherent chaotic fluctations that
   can be readily observed in even relatively simple flow scenarios. The most widely ueed analyitcal turbulence models are Navier-Stoke type models and decompose the flow
   into a mean flow component and a stochastically fluctauting flow componenet. Averaging the resulting equations leads to a tractable model for the mean field flow. However,
   there is a problem of closure of the Reynold's stress term. Most commonly, the Bousinessq hypothesis is used to close the mean flow equations. This hypothesis is an energy
   model that accounts for the energy dissipation in a cascade down the length scales of eddies. This allows us to relate the Reynold's stress solely to the mean flow and
   obtain a fully closed set of equations.
   In most urban settings models for the mean flow are usually sufficient - the effect of stochastic fluctations is relatively mild. However, in higher turbulent scenarios,
   (e.g. oceanic models) these models become insufficient.
   In this project, I explore these techniques, and apply then in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework.

   The project proposal involved working alongside a structural engineering company and using OpenFOAM CFD turbulence modelling to conduct stress analysis
   on the boundaries of a given house structure, subject to a widely accepted model for the flow profile in the atmospheric boundary layer. I also decided to conduct
   some pedestrian analysis - looking at how the wind flow is distorted by the presence of the house structure.

   <u><b>Main Challenges:</b></u> <br>
   **Computational Demand:**
   One of the biggest challenges in CFD is the large computational demand asscoiated with running a simulation on a sufficiently refined computational mesh. Whilst a sufficiently
   refined mesh is desireable to allow for adequate 'blending' to occur through the viscous sublayer that forms close to the solid boundaries, a trade off can be made in reducing the
   mesh resolution and using interpolating 'wall functions', that are widely studied and proposed in the literature, and based on idealised experiments. This was a particularly
   necessary approach, since I didn't have access to a powerful machine. <br>
   **Numerical Discretisation:**
   It was important to develop an understanding of how to translate the theory of fluid dynamics into a numerical framework. This included making decisions on the
   most suitable finite volume schemes (FVS) to use for each operator and how to discretise the physical quantities: space, time, energy & angle. It was also necessary
   to develop an understanding of exactly how the OpenFOAM software operates, for example, how each field is mapped through the geometry of successive cells in the mesh.

  name: The Magneto-Active Elastica - Coupling Classical Theories of Elasticity & Magnetism

   <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
   Traditionally, classical theories of elasticity and magnetism are studied in isolation. However, a recent emergence of exciting engineering applications has prompted the need
   for a unified theory of the *magneto-active elastica*. An example application is to implement non-invasive surgery/drug delivery systems. In this context, microscale, hard-magnetic
   'robots' that cannot faesibly be motorised due to the associated length scale are able to be locomoted deterministically via. an externally applied magnetic field.

    The aim of this dissertation is two-fold. Firstly, to unify the theory of elastic rods with magnetism. This will be done by considering suitable conservation/balance laws and
    enrgy minimisation principles, which upon applying constitutive relationships specific to the material, will result in a closed, non-linear, differential system. After the
    governing equations have been set out, we solve for the steady state deflections under various classes of applied magnetic fields, which in principle can be mapped onto a
    target location in space when viewed as an *inverse problem*.

#   Seashells showcase a beautiful example of biological growth and pattern formation. The brittle, calcite structures are the result of an accretive growth process eminating
#   from the valve - a thin, elastic organ of the inhabitant mollusc. From a global perspective, seashells often exhibit fascinating geometric properties, such as self-similarity,
#   mathematical regularity and structural ornamentations. These observations prompt many interesting questions about how these features arise. The key to answering this is
#   to understand the growth process on local level: how the molluscs themselves operate, i.e. what are the growth 'rules' that govern the secretion of shell mass from the mantle.
#
#   I am currently writting my dissertation on this topic. I will be focussing both on the growth and form of seashells. That will include developing a geometric framework to describe
#   the accretive shell growth process and establishing models for the instability mechanisms driving mechanical pattern formation, resulting in shell ornamentations such as ribs and spines.
#   I will be implementing these models into a computational framework in Mathematica. Under this framework, I will be able to replicate examples of specific shells and potentially be able to
#   make inference on the evolutionary history of the species, under the model parameters that give rise to the shell replication.
