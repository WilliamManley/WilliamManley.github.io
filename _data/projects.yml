    **Project Outline:** Under supervision of the Micron research group at the University of Oxford,
    I worked on early stage development of the MicroscoPi imaging platform.
    The aim of the project was to produce a fully automated, robust, 3D printed
    microscopy platform. Specifically, my task was to develop and implement a
    fully automated autofocus module that the user could run on any prepared
    sample slide and readily obtain an observable sample. <br>
