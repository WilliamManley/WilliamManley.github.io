    **Project Outline:** <br>
    Under supervision of the Micron research group at the University of Oxford,
    I worked on early stage development of the MicroscoPi imaging platform.
    The aim of the project was to produce a fully automated, robust, 3D printed
    microscopy platform. Specifically, my task was to develop and implement a
    fully automated autofocus module that the user could run on any prepared
    sample slide and readily obtain an observable sample. <br> <br>
    **Main Challenges:** <br>
    **No Reference Image:**
    One thing that made this project unique was having no 'reference image' to compare
    against, since we needed to apply our module to any given prepared sample, and we
    were starting from a completely unfocused image. Hence, a "no reference pixel based" method
    (NRP) as commonly referenced in relevant literature was employed as the logical approach. <br>
    **Quantifying Focus:**
    The main problem that we needed to address was how to devise a metric to
    quantify how in/out of focus a sample is at each stage of the automated process. This
    corresponded to characterising the image artefact of 'blur' at each stage. <br> <br>

    **Project Presentation:** A presentation of my research can be found here.
