   Digitally Transforming Farming
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The farming industry has experienced a recent transition into the era of *precision agriculture*. With the availability of data skyrocketting in recent years,
    the industry has been hit by a wave of interest and use cases that machine learning and computer vision techniques can be applied to. <br>

    Seasonal variation in the past has made farming an incredibly volatile market - the influence of machine learning has allowed for predictions to be made
    that can allow farmers to maximise their potential yields. By feeding in a constant stream of data giving insight on features ranging from soil pH to
    precipitation volumes, an increase of as much as 300% to a farmer's profits can be expected.

    <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
    Our team was tasked with the problem of extracting the crop type contained within a specific field. We were given georeferenced satellite imagery of whole farms and access to
    the company database containg vital information such as: field boundary coordinates, crop types by field ID, planting dates, etc. The problem was two-fold: a large part of the
    process was to develop a data pre-processing pipeline that would mould data into a suitable format to train our ML models with. Once the data was ready for use, lots of work
    was done on model selection, building neural network architectures and fine-tuning various hyperparamaters upon the evaluation of model performances. Two methods were used:
    a convolutional neural network was employed in attempt to extract the most 'natural' features. A time series approach was also taken with the idea of mapping spectral footprints
    to unique crop types.

    <u><b>Main Challenges:</b></u> <br>
    **Dealing with Big Data:**
    It was necessary to optimise the infastructure of the data pre-processing pipeline using multi-processing/multi-threading, etc. due to the size of data that needed handling.
    A single raw data instance contained pixel values for a whole image across 4 spectral bands along with geospatial and semantic labelling. The model required a substatinal number
    of data points (~1,000) across each class for the models to perform well, hence this was a key process in accelerating the stream of dataflow.<br>
    **Pre-Processing Challenges:**
    A lot of pre-processing was needed to ensure that the data was in a format that would be susceptible to our model frameworks. The data needed to be labelled, filtered and linked
    accordingly throughout the commpany database. We then needed to clip out specific fields from whole farm images by using the georeferencing data. The images needed to be downsampled -
    model performance was largely unaffected with a relatively large amount of downsampling. New features such as the *Normalised Difference Vegative Index*, which is a metric characterising
    the amount of biomass present in an image were calculated and found to be important features. It was necessary to standardise image arrays were to aid model performance: images were padded/cropped
    to standard dimensions and pixel intensities were normalised. A data augmentation process was implemented to produce artificial data points to bulk up some classes with low data count and a principle
    component analysis was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
