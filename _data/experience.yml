   *Digitally Transforming Farming*
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The farming industry has experienced a recent transition into the era of *precision agriculture*. With the availability of data skyrocketting in recent years,
    the industry has been hit by a wave of interest and use cases for machine learning and computer vision techniques. Seasonal variation in the past has made farming an
    incredibly volatile market - the influence of machine learning has allowed for predictions to be made that can allow farmers to maximise their potential yields. By feeding in
    a constant stream of data giving insight on features ranging from soil pH to precipitation volumes, an increase of as much as 300% to a farmer's profits can be expected.

    <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
    Our team was given the problem of extracting the crop type contained in a specific field, given 12 band satellite imager
