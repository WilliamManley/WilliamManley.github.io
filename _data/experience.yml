   Digitally Transforming Farming
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The farming industry has experienced a recent transition into the era of *precision agriculture*. With the availability of data skyrocketting in recent years,
    the industry has been hit by a wave of interest and use cases for machine learning and computer vision techniques. <br>

    Seasonal variation in the past has made farming an incredibly volatile market - the influence of machine learning has allowed for predictions to be made
    that can allow farmers to maximise their potential yields. By feeding in a constant stream of data giving insight on features ranging from soil pH to
    precipitation volumes, an increase of as much as 300% to a farmer's profits can be expected.

    <u><b>Project Outline:</b></u> <br>
    Our team was tasked with the problem of extracting the crop type contained within a specific field. We were given georeferenced satellite imagery of whole farms and access to
    the company database containg vital information such as: field boundary coordinates, crop types by field ID, planting dates, etc. The problem was two-fold: a large part of the
    process was to develop a data pre-processing pipeline that would mould data into a suitable format to train our ML models with, after this, work was done on fine tuning and evaluation
    of various model performances.

    <u><b>Main Challenges:</b></u> <br>
    **Dealing with Big Data:**
    Optimised pipeline with multi-processing/multi-threading ... Description of the many features ...<br>
    **Pre-Processing Challenges:**
    Talk about all the stages.
